Registration

Document Image Analysis researchers must register to access the dataset and to download 
parts of it. Use of the dataset is strictly for personal research and not for any 
commercial use. Reproduction and/or redistribution of any part of the dataset is not 
allowed. See also the Copyright section below.


Functionality

Browsing and searching are supported to select documents satisfying a number of different 
criteria, ranging from layout features to image characteristics.
Images and ground truth can be examined efficiently at different levels of detail without 
downloading full-sized files.
Ad-hoc collections of documents can be constructed e.g. for the evaluation of methods 
focussing on specific layout analysis challenges.
Downloads include the page image, associated ground truth file as well as a set of files 
that enable local off-line browsing using an SVG viewer.


Copyright

Scanned pages (all images) are available in the dataset exclusively for personal research 
and, in general, must not be reproduced in any form (even in scientific publications) 
without the permission of the copyright holder(s). Information on the copyright holder(s) 
is displayed for every page image in the dataset in order to make it possible to identify 
who to seek permission from.
We are working towards securing permission from publishers so that researchers can freely 
use images and reproduce them in scientific publications. Wherever such permission is 
available, it is indicated in the metadata and displayed for each page image.
