Using Segueme server scripts
----------------------------

Server side code uses Apache's default configuration. The only extra software
needed is Python version 3. Apache must be able to handle an Python script.

Development web server's directory looks like:
diego@debian-psi:~$ ls -lh /var/www/
total 12K
drwx------ 2 www-data www-data 4.0K May  3 01:34 feed
-rw-r--r-- 1 root     root      177 Mar  9 12:48 index.html
drwxr-xr-x 2 root     root     4.0K May  3 01:35 scripts

Debian is being used here but of course any properly configured web server or
SO can be employed. Also, Python interpreter must be able to write to "feed"
directory and "scripts" should contain provided "read_input.py" script that 
needs execution permissions.

So, web server receives data in:
http://SERVER_IP/scripts/read_input.py
And writes it to:
http://SERVER_IP/feed/DEVICE_IMEI.xml
