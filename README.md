# Basic image manipulation under Octave
This work explores image manipulation algorithms. All code was developed under 
Octave 3.8.1 on a slow Atom netbook. This means that I was forced to avoid for
loops and just stick to vector or matrix indexing. I didn't knew before but 
both Matlab and Octave are way faster when used this way.

# Algorithms
Below is a description file by file of the implementations.

## Histogram Compression
## Zooming
## Median filter
