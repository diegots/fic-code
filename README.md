Toplevel like tool and documentation for Benjamin C. Pierce's untyped lambda calculus library.
Introduction
------------
The task in hand was to develop a small toplevel tool, a REPL environment, where
a lambda-calculus expresion can be tested. We used the untyped lambda
implementation available on [Benjamin C. Pierce' site]
(https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/tapl/checkers/fulluntyped.tar.gz)
Also, some comments were added to the original source code using Ocamldoc.
